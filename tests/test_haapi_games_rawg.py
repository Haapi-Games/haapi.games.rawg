    "The graphics solution of the game may seem simple at first glance, but"
    " in fact, it is very addictive and elaborated with the exceptional talent "
    "of the artist. Reminds the best samples from the history of world "
    "animation. There is an impression that the directors and operators of "
    "the highest Hollywood level worked on all the scenes in the game - "
    "the hero's simple passage through the hanging ladder suddenly turns into an "
    "exciting panorama that you want to admire for a long time. Voices speaking "
    "the ancient Scandinavian languages, and beautiful original music help to "
    "create a tangible atmosphere of Nordic folklore and adventure.â€¨These "
    "advantages draw attention to the game, despite the lack of continuous "
    "action. There is no such action in the game, but when it does happen, "
    "its epic nature is suited to the world of Nordic fairy tales. Plots of "
    "these tales and a description of the world of Nordic myths are adequately "
    "represented in the game, it is even possible to study this topic. "
    "The gameplay consists of exploring large levels, searching for runes to "
    "enter the next level, avoiding various exotic troubles and rare but "
    "epic and picturesque battles."
